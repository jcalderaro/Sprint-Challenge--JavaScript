## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

    The syntax `.forEach` will iterate through an array and find the info you specify. 
        However it won't return anything. Where as `.map` will still iterates through an array, 
            finds the info, and return it in a new array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

    "A function returns a value, but a procedure does not. 
        A method is similar to a function, but is internal to part of a class" -https/StackExchange

3. What is closure?
    
    A `closure` is a variable nested within a function that can be utilized by other 
        functions also within the original functions scope.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.   

    "The four rules presented for determining what `this` is in JavaScript 
        points to boil down to one simple question: 
            What is the calling object?
                1. Is the function called by new?
                2. Is the function called by call(), apply(), or bind()?
                3. Is the function called as a method, ie: obj.func()?
                4. Is the function called in the global scope?"

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

    We need it because the super() function is used to tell a parent's constructor 
        to be concerned with the child's attributes. i.e the parent has a specific
            method that we want the child to be able to use.
